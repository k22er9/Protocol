### Description

Ontology implements a series of blockchain based protocols, including Orange - a Reputation Protocol (a community-driven project). 

Mission, as on the main page: Bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions.

Ontology has a trust search engine which provides authentication and connects services for individuals. 

> At Ontology, we envision a future where your identity and data are protected through encryption. Your on and off-chain data are secured without stress or worry. With **ONT ID**, you can protect your identity and data without constant oversight or maintenance. Using ONT ID prevents malicious actors from hijacking your identity or accessing personal information. We're building a future that guarantees you total control over who can access, see, and use your online data and identity.

## UTU

- Web: https://utu.io/
- GitHub: https://github.com/utu-protocol
- Stage: in development (updated whitepaper Aug 10, 2022). MVP: http://defi-portal.utu.io/
### Description

From main page:

> UTU’s mission is to become the trust infrastructure of the entire internet, replacing anonymous star ratings, reviews, and scores as the de facto trust mechanisms of our digital lives.

From UTU Protocol Whitepaper V4:

> UTU was born to help people take these five actions: Connect, Send, Swap, Stake, & Borrow. We have removed most of the clutter about Web 2 use cases and reframed UTU around the core problems it solves for:
> - Connect: Is this Dapp going to drain my wallet?
> - Send: Is this the right address? Do I need to do a test transaction?
> - Swap: Is the real token? Should I really buy this?
> - Stake: Will I get my funds back? And the promised yield?
> - Borrow: Is the borrower going to pay back?

From the protocol page:

> How the UTU Protocol Works:
> - You should earn from the reviews you create and the data you share. UTU pays you for creating trustworthy reviews and ratings and for sharing your data with apps that you use.
> - Fake and inaccurate reviews can lead to poor purchase decisions. The UTU protocol leverages blockchain to ensure that reviews can’t be manipulated.
> - Big tech companies capture and use your data without you even knowing it. With UTU, you have full control over the data you share.
