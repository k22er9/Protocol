### Principles

The reputation system is a configurable set of principles and rules embodied in a system of smart contracts written in the Solidity language.

Reputation system is designed for use in systems, services, DAOs and communities, in which participants can give each other marks for some interactions - both paid (performance of works, consultations) and unpaid. Proof of commission is applicable only for paid interactions.

Here are some of core principles:

1. Proof of Commission
2. Responsibility
	1. Responsible rates
	2. Responsible invites
	3. Guarantors
3. Attributive rates
4. P2P crowdsourcing
	1. Verification
	2. Dispute resolution
	3. Court system
5. True ownership and service agnostic
6. Scam Resistance
7. Handling of abnormally bad grades

#### Protection against artificial sway/attack of lowering the profile?

**Case:** 10 users register on the network, create orders for $1 and they are all fulfilled by user X. For this he gets a high score from everyone.

**Case:** the user gets a batch of ones in a row - an organized attack on the profile.

If the user receives an abnormal score (below half of the current average reputation), the score is frozen and the user is quarantined.

If the dispute has not been opened by either party, the score is discarded.

#### The Macroeconomics of Reputation

##### Usecases

**P2P Guarantor** ‚Äì a community member with a sufficiently high reputation who can guarantee the quality of interactions with another community member - new or with little reputation - in exchange for a share of the profits.

Guarantor is responsible by its reputation for the assignee for the entire term of the guarantee given. In case the guarantor receives low grades, it decreases the reputation of the guarantor. In case of positive evaluations it increases. The rate of increase and decrease of the reputation of the guarantor is regulated by the set coefficients and is one of the tools for tuning the reputation macroeconomics.

**Main scenario ‚Äì** solve the problem when a new member of the community has no reputation at all and because of this it can be very difficult for him to get the first orders and prove himself

**Side Scenarios**

1. The outstaff team manager vouches for the quality of all team members
2. A top-notch renowned expert audits the performer's competencies and vouches for him in the event of a successful test
3. Course instructor vouches for his students - performers on the platform, and helps them in case of problems to successfully perform tasks
4. Professional guarantors are community members who are good at identifying qualifications and predicting the quality of services provided by the performer. Possibly help with the most difficult cases to avoid negative evaluations.

**How it works**

Let's take the basic scenario as an example.

**Background**. There is some community S with a reputation system R, in which scientific experts advise each other for a fee. There is a respected member of the community with a high reputation (20K) named A. There is a new member of the community, B, who is also a high-level expert, but has just registered on the platform and his reputation is 0. A and B know each other well.

1. B asks A to act as his guarantor, and A agrees.
2. A with the UI calls the method in R: R.guarantee()

##### Features

###### Attributive rates

The reputation of the performer grows in the industry in which he performs the contract. If you do design, your reputation in design grows, dev grows your reputation in dev, and so on. One performer can have several skills and accordingly several reputations.

There should also be a separate, unified reputation of the customer. Conventionally, as it is implemented in taxi services, where the driver evaluates the passenger. The higher the reputation of the passenger, the better driver will come to him.

Motivations for giving grades can be divided into two notional groups: positive and negative.

**Positive**:

1. If the user puts a rating/writes a comment his reputation grows more than 100%.
2. Explanatory material that tells the importance of each grade.
3. Game mechanics. Achievement of certain levels, special achifks in the form of NFTs. As an example, consider DuoLingvo.
4. The more reviews and orders you make in a month, the lower the commission. Each month, the lower the commission begins again.
5. A scale like in P2P binance that shows completed transactions and % of reviews written/written. Could be an additional factor when choosing a customer/executor.
6. Users see reviews that previous users have left and can like them. If your review helped, you get extra reputation. The more likes the post has, the higher it is worth.
7. A reminder in your personal account or by email. "You didn't leave a review for Ilon Musk, please do, it's very important for Ilon.
8. If the performer has no reviews/ratings then the first one who put gets more reputation. A system that automatically monitors parameters and tunes them.

**Negative**:

1. As long as the performer hasn't put a grade/written a review to the customer, the performer doesn't get any money.
2. You get less reputation without a review or evaluation.
3. You can only make a certain number of deals without rating/writing a review. If you exceed this number, you are quarantined for some time.

**Cross-Service Reputation** can be implemented like ratings for movies. It is conditionally possible to load reputation from other services and show it as a widget.

For some services, you might consider a grading system in the form of smiley faces. As an example of a reaction on FB.

## Reputation model

**Main Terms**

The system consists of agents A1, A2, ..., who interact via transactions T1, T2, ...

Agent An can initiate an interaction with agent Am.

The interaction can be unidirectional (asymmetric) or bidirectional (symmetric). *todo: what‚Äôs the difference?*

*In some systems (watch a video and rate it with likes - no consent of both parties to interact is required, in others like Upwork - it is required)*

Each agent `An` has a function - estimate the result of the interaction `RateSubjectiveN(T1(An, Am)) -> RateNM`.

*In the case of symmetric interaction, two estimates are made:*

`RateSubjectiveN(T1(An, Am)) -> RateNM`

`RateSubjectiveM(T1(An, Am)) -> RateMN`

Each agent `A1`, `A2`, ... corresponds to `RateObj1`, `RateObj2`, ..., which integrates results of interactions directed to `A1`, `A2`, ...

There is a function that updates `RateObj` for `A` based on the results of the `T` interaction:

`RateUpdate(RateObj_M, RateMN) -> RateObj_M_updated`

**Why a reputation system is needed**

The main purpose of the reputation system is to give the most accurate prediction of the results of interactions between agents.

There is a system of `Com` interacting agents `A1`, `A2`, ...

Each agent has a regularly changing indicator of satisfaction - Contentment. As a result of the interaction at least one of the parties changes this indicator.

The quality of the Com system depends on the total increase in satisfaction ‚à´ (‚àë(Contentment_i, i, 1...n), (t, 0, Com_lifetime), dt) over the lifetime of the system.

The more agents the better.

The more interactions between them, the better.

The longer the system lives, the better.

**The higher the increase in satisfaction with the results of each of the interactions, the better**

In the general

`Interaction(A1, A2, context1, context2) ->`

`UpdateContentment1(Cont1) -> Cont1_updated,`

`UpdateContentment2(Cont2) -> Cont2_updated,`

Interactions can be context-free, containing one or two contexts.

Context `Cont_n` of the `Tmn` agent `An` interaction - special conditions for the `Tmn` interaction. For example, the text of the task.

Examples of two-context interaction:

1. a complex transaction where each party does something for the other party. For example, a service for a service
2. the acquaintance of two people; the contexts in this case are who each of the couple would like to meet

For different contexts, the result of interaction between the same agents may be different.

In order to optimize aggregate satisfaction, it is necessary to:

1. maximize the number of interactions that increase satisfaction
2. select for interactions such agents (given the current contexts), for which the total increase in satisfaction will be maximum
3. Avoid interactions that will result in lower overall satisfaction

In order to choose the interactions for which the increase in satisfaction will be maximal, it is necessary to predict the satisfaction of the agents.

`PredictContentments(A1, A2, Context1, Context2) ->`

`-> (‚àÇContentment1, ‚àÇContentment2)`

### DREP Overview

- Web: https://www.drep.org , https://medium.com/drep-family
- Github: https://github.com/drep-project
- Stage: is not actively maintained - last commit was in 2021
- News: https://t.me/drep_foundation_announcements

#### Description

From the main page:

> Drep is committed to building a "connector" and "toolbox" based on blockchain technology, providing solutions with ease of use, flexibility and no impact.
> 
> Based on drep underlying public chain, drep decentralized ID system, drep reputation protocol layer and drep SDK, we can build an open data ecology on the chain and break the current situation of separation of public chain ecology.

From [docs](https://docs.drep.org/technology-advantages/reputation/):

DREP Reputation System is a comprehensive close-loop ecosystem which includes a general reputation protocol, reputation pipeline interface, reputation on-chain data storage and algorithm library, reputation reward system, reputation value account management and fake account identification mechanisms. In the ecosystem, users‚Äô behavior is linked to their reputation which will be evaluated by multiple interacting parties. Users will also receive complete real-time updates on their reputation.

### Ontology

- Web: https://ont.io/
- Github: https://github.com/ontio
- Stage: in production

#### Description

Ontology implements a series of blockchain based protocols, including Orange - a Reputation Protocol (a community-driven project). 

Mission, as on the main page: Bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions.

Ontology has a trust search engine which provides authentication and connects services for individuals. 

> At Ontology, we envision a future where your identity and data are protected through encryption. Your on and off-chain data are secured without stress or worry. With **ONT ID**, you can protect your identity and data without constant oversight or maintenance. Using ONT ID prevents malicious actors from hijacking your identity or accessing personal information. We're building a future that guarantees you total control over who can access, see, and use your online data and identity.

### Orange protocol

- Web: https://www.orangeprotocol.io
- GitHub: https://github.com/orange-protocol
- Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem availability: may work on EVM parachains (not targeting them)
- Networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC

#### Orange protocol description

From [overview](https://docs.orangeprotocol.io/overview):

> On-chain data is currently scattered across a myriad of decentralized applications. Many types of actions take place in the form of transactions associated with wallet addresses.
> 
> However, if we were to take that transaction data, extract and consolidate useful data points together turning them into well-defined schemas, this data can prove to be very useful in assessing an entity's on-chain identity for specific contexts. Orange is to achieve just that.
> 
> Orange is a reputation and trust minting protocol that aggregates data and Web3 reputation models to generate comprehensive reputation proofs in the form of Verifiable Credentials and NFTs.

#### Our differences

- Orange doesn't provide means to create reputation (via voting or other means),
  it only helps with aggregating on-chain data to interpret facts and behavior as reputation aspects.
  While theoretically this can be used for WorkFi, this makes each service that reads or modifies one's reputation
  to reinvent the wheel. We believe that ready-to-use reputation aspects and procedures for their modification
  will be much more helpful for the industry

### UTU

- Web: https://utu.io
- GitHub: https://github.com/utu-protocol
- Stage: in development (updated whitepaper Aug 10, 2022). MVP: http://defi-portal.utu.io/
- Networks: Ethereum, bridged to BSC, will be bridged to Polygon, and to other chains
- Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem availability: may work on EVM parachains (not targeting them)

#### Description

From main page:

> UTU‚Äôs mission is to become the trust infrastructure of the entire internet, replacing anonymous star ratings, reviews, and scores as the de facto trust mechanisms of our digital lives.

From UTU Protocol Whitepaper V4:

> UTU was born to help people take these five actions: Connect, Send, Swap, Stake, & Borrow. We have removed most of the clutter about Web 2 use cases and reframed UTU around the core problems it solves for:
> - Connect: Is this Dapp going to drain my wallet?
> - Send: Is this the right address? Do I need to do a test transaction?
> - Swap: Is the real token? Should I really buy this?
> - Stake: Will I get my funds back? And the promised yield?
> - Borrow: Is the borrower going to pay back?

From the protocol page:

> How the UTU Protocol Works:
> - You should earn from the reviews you create and the data you share. UTU pays you for creating trustworthy reviews and ratings and for sharing your data with apps that you use.
> - Fake and inaccurate reviews can lead to poor purchase decisions. The UTU protocol leverages blockchain to ensure that reviews can‚Äôt be manipulated.
> - Big tech companies capture and use your data without you even knowing it. With UTU, you have full control over the data you share.

UTU uses an own fungible, non-transferable token (UTU Trust Token) for reputation count.

#### Our differences

- UTU focuses on providing 'trust' which is an important aspect of reputation but not enough for WorkFi
  as it doesn't tell anything about the skills/quality of previous work;
  other aspects like contribution to community should also be supported by a reputation system;
- another UTU's focus is privacy: whitepaper says "we want users to be able to fully control
  who gets to access their data when, for what reason, in what context etc".
  We, on the other hand, envision reputation as something publicly available (transparent),
  any person or service should have read access to it (and reputation flaws should not be hidden)



# Responsibility

## Responsible rates

Scores that go against the community result in a loss.

### Handling abnormal scores

#### A client is offended by life and gives the worker a minimal rate. Dispute is not open.

If the worker receives a low score, it is quarantined. This is a mode of the score in which it is not displayed and is not accounted in the worker's overall rating (displayed by UI).

If the next 5 scores are higher than the average reputation of the user, the ‚Äúbad‚Äù score is discarded ‚Äì implying that participants "did not match".

If a score *lower than the average* (?) comes among the next 5 scores, the low score gets accounted. In this case (*in both cases?*), the abnormal score can be disputed.

**The problem being solved** is ‚Äúspoiling‚Äù one‚Äôs rating due to miscommunication.

**An adjacent case**: a user with low rating (a not-so-decent community member) gets an abnormally high score (is that a favor or a real improvement?). It also gets quarantined and is applied if the next scores ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù it. Note: a dispute is unlikely in this case as both sides are not interested in it.

**Procedure details**

User A has a high rating: their scores are usually in the range 90-100 (with 100 being maximum).

UserB, based on his work/political/religious/personal considerations, gives UserA a score of 10%.

Since the average grade for A = 100+90 / 2 = 95%, the threshold for an acceptable grade would be 42%.

Since 10<42, we believe that the estimate is abnormal. We mark it as suspicious .

Start observing the 5 subsequent evaluations. If the subsequent scores are higher than (100+90-10) / 3 = 60%, consider that the low score was abnormal - discard it from the history and remove the user from quarantine.

In this case, the threshold of the acceptable score has increased - an additional incentive for UserA.

If UserA, in observation mode, gets a score lower than (100+90-10) / 3 = 60%, consider that the score from UserB may have been deserved - include it in the overall statistics.

**Early withdrawal from observation**

UserA can open DisputeResolution.

If the dispute is resolved in favor of A, the score is discarded.

If the argument is in favor of B, A's low grade is counted instantly. Observation mode is terminated.

#### The user gives the performer a 1 for non-good reason. Dispute is open

The user gives the performer a low score and opens a dispute.

Then there are three options for the development of events:

- the performer is found to be at fault. The evaluation goes into the performer's reputation.
- the dispute is resolved in the side of the performer. The score is not counted in the reputation, or a high score is given (by the arbitrator's decision)
- the parties go to a settlement - we believe that the reputation of the performer and the customer does not suffer - both get A's (it is advantageous to go to a settlement)

#### The contractor deliberately fails to complete the order. Dispute Resolution.

If the contractor openly walks away from the order, the arbitrator recognizes the dispute in favor of the customer. The contractor is given a low reputation score.

The contractor cannot take orders during the week.

#### The performer has gone bad in life. Started to forget about everything. Depression.

In such a scenario, the reputation of the user tends to 0. Other users see the low reputation and do not accept the risk. The only way to fix reputation is to take on "cheap" orders, where customers are willing to take a risk and work with an unreliable performer.

####  The ratio of the value of the order to the reputation received.

Very important is the ratio of the cost of the order to the reputation that the contractor gets. The idea is that the higher the cost of the order, the higher the risk for non-performance. A high risk should lead to a high reward.

At the same time, it is clear that a client with an "expensive" order will not go to a person with a low reputation for help.

That's how we get two leagues: the "higher" and the "premier".

The highest league, where the user is offered expensive orders. For the execution of orders, the user receives a high reputation and, at the same time, for a failed order the user will be severely punished.

"Premier" league is the lower segment - users with a low reputation get offers at a low cost. It turns out that it takes time and effort to get to the top league.

The benefit is that, with this approach, the reputation is not made up of one expensive project, but of many smaller projects that have been completed.

## Responsible invites (vouching)

Once a user reaches the reputation threshold, he receives an invite. This invite can be used to invite a new user to the network.

The invited user, on start, gets a percentage of the reputation of the inviting user. This is to reflect that probably the better your referrer is, the better you are. Invited user profile shows their inviter. This way, the system indicates WHO is behind the new community member.

Referrals can both help or hurt the inviting user: if the invitee recommends themselves as a trustworthy member of the community, they get reputation increase, and the inviter gets a proportional amount of that reputation for themselves; vice versa, reputation loss is propagated as well.

**Grading system**

Grading system is a methodological technique that allows you to distribute the set of objects under study according to the degree of expression of a common property for them. Such distribution is based on subjective estimates of a given property averaged over a group of experts. In psychology and sociology, rating scales were one of the first to be used. The simplest example of such a scale is the common school grading system. The grading scale has from five to eleven intervals, which can be designated by numbers or verbally. **It is considered that a person's psychological abilities don't allow him to classify objects on more than 11 to 13 items**. The possibility of constructing a rating scale is based on the assumption that each expert is able to directly quantify the objects under study. The basic scaling procedures include:

1. England - A\*, A, B, C, D, E, F, G
2. USA -  A, B, C, D, F
3. Japan - * yuu(ÂÑ™): A (90-100%)
* ryou(ËâØ): B (70-<90%)
* ka(ÂèØ): C (60-<70%)
* fuka(‰∏çÂèØ): F (0-<60%)
1. Europe - 10 and 5 point systems.
2. Apple Store, Google play, Yandex, UBER, BOLT, Glovo, Aliexpress, Wechat, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon - 5 point system. We can conclude that most of humanity understands the 5 point system.
3. Pain Rating Scale - 10 point with emoji.
4. In terms of usability, Amazon has the best system.
5.  Preset grades

**Scale 1-5**

**Pros:** This is a very common scale that everyone is already familiar with.

It provides a more neutral position.

**Cons:** A neutral position is not always informative.

**Scale 1-6**

**Pros:** The guest cannot choose a neutral position and must choose a positive or negative evaluation.

**Cons:** This is not a very common scale

Not all guests consider 3/6 a bad review or 4/6 a good review.

**Scale 1-10**

This scale is used by Booking.com.

**Pros:** It allows you to evaluate your staff and monitor your services

Your customer can make more detailed choices.

**Cons:** You get more survey results, which will have an average rating, because of the large scaling

Getting a 10 is not easy because the scale is very large. A 10 will mean that for guests their entire stay was delightful

Numerical scales have a serious disadvantage. The perception of such a scale is highly dependent on the respondent. A score of 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 can mean anything from good to barely acceptable to different people. Also, some people have a much harder time justifying a category choice at the far end of the scale than others. All of this leads respondents with the same opinion to choose different categories, creating a source of error in the survey. These errors, in turn, make it difficult to figure out the actual opinion that the data represent.

# P2P crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing involves obtaining work, information, or opinions from a large group of people. Our focus is to use crowdsourcing for verification and dispute resolution. Both flows imply two roles: initiator - a person requesting a verification or dispute resolution and guarantors - one or multiple community members having required qualifications.

The reputation provider offers tokens and/or reputation for community members with required qualifications to guarantee that there are always some guarantors and resolvers available to avoid processing delays.

Important: under the hood, we are dealing with keys. Key-Person match is an extra topic and it is out of the scope of this document.

## Verification

Verification is the process of establishing the truth, accuracy, or validity of something. For example - both apostilles and certifications are used by foreign governments to assess the authenticity of an official signature on a document.

Big industries or a growing startup trying to take over the market require digital identity verification to connect customers to whatever they need.

### Verification in the non community driven real world

Using online services ofter requires validation/verification. For example, using exchanges like Binance requires providing documents confirming the identity. Multiple hosting companies require to send documents for account activation. Several companies have integrated even more strict verification using video calls. There are multiple identity verification services on the market. iDenfy https://www.idenfy.com/ is one of them used for ID Document Verification, Face Recognition with 3D Liveness Detection, and is fully AML compliant. iDenfy and similar services protect companies from identity fraud.

Another common real-world example of verification is issuing a 'certificate'. For example, a university confirms the knowledge in a specific domain by issuing an official document.

### How does it work in the community driven systems.

The difference from the existing solutions is to crowdsource guarantors for the verification process instead of having paid staff responsible for verification.

Guarantors willing to verify are called verificators. A person who requests verification is called verification initializer.

A verification service provider provides a secure and reliable solution to instantly verify consumers' attributes (identity, knowledge, etc) online. The verification flow is specific to the attribute to verify and might be predefined by the certification service provider. Verificators have to follow step by step flow (if predefined) or use their own methodology to make a decision. For example, phone number verification may imply an online call or sending a confirmation SMS.

Like in a regular verification flow the most important part is the authority truth. In the community-driven systems, we achieve this by checking the reputation of a potential verificator.

A general overview of the verification is as follows:

initiator -> signed verification request -> pool of verification requests -> verificator(s) select a request -> verificaion -> initiator's attribute is verified/not verified using

### Use cases

#### Age verification

An online service filters access to the content based on age. A common approach to verify the age is to provide documents containing the date of birth. Verificators check the documents during an online call and the initiator gets verified by getting a token (SoulBound Tokens - The Non-Transferable NFTs) which acts like an apostille or certification. It's essential that the token is non-transferrable.

#### Knowledge or skills verification

Having a community in mind where one offers knowledge to another it's essential for a service provider to have some reputation (to have some kind of certificate). For example, a web designer should have some experience with html/css/js. The result of verification is a token (SoulBound Tokens - The Non-Transferable NFTs) which acts like a certification. It's essential that the token is non-transferrable.

### Domains and validation logic

There are two main domain groups based on the essence of what should be verified.

Binary domains:

- phone validation
- age validation
- etc

Degree / grade domains:

- skating skills
- database knowledge
- language skills
- etc

Binary domains are as simple as confirming something in a yes/no manner. This group is 'quantity' based. Quantity is relatively trivial to validate.

Grade domains are more subjective. There is potentially a big gap between the opinions of different validators.

The consequence of separating domains is the logic of verification. It's quite simple to validate a phone by calling or sending an SMS. The end decision of one specific validator is a clear yes/no. On the other hand, web technology knowledge is a more complicated case where the initiator could have some level of knowledge - html, css but no js. A natural way to evaluate cases like this is to set let's say 7 from 10 possible points. Skating skills is even more subjective topic.

For the binary domains, the yes/no of all validators should be taken into consideration. The sum gives us the end result. The quorum of validators is 3 or a bigger odd number. This minimum required number of validators is a settable value.

Example: age validation

Validator 1: yes
Validator 2: no
Validator 3: yes
Final decision: yes

For grade domains, we calculate the average as a more flexible way to grade to make it as less as possible subjective. There should be a threshold for a specific domain, let's say 5 points (0 is the min - 9 is the max). The quorum of validators is 1 or bigger. This minimum required number of validators is a settable value.

Example: EN writing skills

Threshold: 5
Validator 1: 7
Validator 2: 5
Validator 3: 6
Average: 6
Final decision: yes / 6

### How to verify technically

Based on domain:

- text (chat) verification
- audio call verification
- video call

For predefined verification flows verificators follow the validator provider's way to verify. If there is no predefined flow a verificator is free to use their own flow to verify.

### Verificator's profit

Verificators are paid in two ways (settable): increased reputation, and/or regular tokens.

There are two main scenarios on paying verificators:

- an initiator pays the verification
- community members pay some kind of membership fee which covers the verification

Verificators are interested in increased reputation because it might lead to access to some restricted, premium content of a service.

Regular tokens reward is self-explanatory.

As a result, a validation provider should always have some active verificators.

### Conflict resolution

If an initiator does not agree with the result there is a way to open a dispute resolution. Possible solutions are:

- a new verification made by another group of verificators
- a new verification with a bigger number of verificators to make subjective opinions more objective.

### Bad verificators

Under 'bad' we mean a verificator whose decision almost always doesn't match the end result. In this case, the reputation of the verificator should be decreased to avoid misuse of the verificator's right. Another solution is to limit temporary access to the verification pool by hitting some threshold (settable value).

### How to become a verificator. Cold start.

The main requirement to a verificator is a dufficient reputation in the specific domain. It automatically implies that a verificator should be verified firstly thus there should be some 'cold start' verificators at start time. This could be a settable value (list) by reputation service provider.

### General implementation details

The initializer places a signed request as proof of the kay ownership. The request contains at least:

- The type: what exactly should be verified - age / skating skills

As for date/time there are tree possible silution
- an initiator places the desired date/time
- validators opens time slots free for verification
- initiator and verificators meet separate agreement about date/time 

Verificators with a reputation above the threshold for the specific type (domain) should be able to list requests in the pool and confirm the participation by signing.

At the specific time a call is initiated and verificators verify what shoul be verified.

An initializer gets a Non-Transferable token.

Verificatoes gets reputation and/or regular tokens.

### How an external service uses a reputation service provider

A service should be able request the desired information in form of: "is the owner of the key under 18"?

## Dispute resolution

In general a dispute resolution is the process of resolving a dispute or conflict between different parties. Crucially, dispute resolution can be a way of solving a conflict without having to go to court. 

There are some advantages to using dispute resolution instead of going to court. Dispute resolution can:

- solve your problem faster
- cost less
- avoid the stress of going to court
- help preserve your relationship with the other party
- be confidential
- be flexible and provide a range of outcomes
- help achieve mutual agreement

Dispute resolution is not suitable for:

- some types of dispute, for example domestic abuse
- issues needing urgent court action, such as to prevent you losing something
- the outcome needs to be legally binding
- the other party is unwilling to take part in dispute resolution

### Dispute resolution logic

Using a common communications ways like

- text
- audio
- call

a resolver should take in consideration meaning two parts of a dispute. To avoid any conflicts it's better do make two independent calls. Based on the information a resolver tries to solve a dispute. The goal is not to decide who is right but to find a suitable solution for both parts.

### Duspute resolution between community members

In a community it's hard to 'hold' payment for a service, if payment is already performed. The real instrument to enforce better communication is reputation. Thus if part 1 offered some services to part 2 and part 2 won't pay we don't really have an intrument to enforce the payment.

What we can do is adjusting reputation in case of conflicts.

#### Form of resolution

Locked balance is unlocked for specific part.

### Dispute resulution between comunity member and a service provider


#### Form of resolution

Example: A commutiony memner doesn't agree with validation of his EN writing skills. (negative outcome)

Final decision to confirm or not to confirm EN writing skills.

## Proof of Commission

<span style="color:red">
	MOVE FROM MIRO, KIR
</span>

Proof of Commission principle (in P2P reputation systems): in order to earn 1 unit of reputation, you need to spend 1 USD in the form of commission and get a positive score as a result of paid P2P interaction.

This principle does not define the recipient of the commission - it can be a community fund, a reserve pool, a service commission. However, the commission payer cannot be the sole and direct beneficiary of that commission.

This principle is necessary to avoid reputation bumping (cheating).
